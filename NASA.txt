From Ross Beyer at NASA,

Interesting project. The Ames Stereo Pipeline does best when parameters about the cameras are very well known (as we get from spacecraft instruments). Photos from hand-held cameras over a hundred years ago is going to be challenging with our software. Not impossible, but not ideal, either.

You might want to look into Microsoft's Photosynth project, or read about the "Building Rome in a Day" project (http://grail.cs.washington.edu/rome/) which does the same, but with lots more images that you have. These might lead you off into other software or projects that might be better for your problem.
